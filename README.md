# Persistance of Vision Display ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨
Project made as part of my Robotics course at the University of Bucharest.

## Persistance of Vision
*"the retention of a visual image for a short period of time after the removal of the stimulus that produced it: the phenomenon that produces the illusion of movement when viewing motion pictures." Source: www.dictionary.com*

As the definition implies persistance of vision is having a set of images that you show and hide at a rapid rate, therefore creating an animation. In our case the images are a sequence of leds that turn on and off to give the illusion of letters.
